              Hey there! I'm PanoðŸ‘‹, a Junior Front-End Web developer based in
              Melbourne and I'm excited to show you what I can do! I love
              playing with web development and UX/UI design, and I always try to
              bring my A-game to every project I work on. I've worked as a
              Junior Front-End Web developer at &nbsp;
              <a href="https://www.nintendo.com.au/">Nintendo</a>, where I was
              responsible for maintaining and updating website content in
              coordination with global stakeholders, and also involved in the
              development and delivery of new features. Before that, I worked at
              &nbsp;<a href="https://edcursion.com.au/">Edcursion</a> as a
              Junior Fullstack developer where I contributed to the development
              of a custom UI library and assisted with the creation of a backend
              API. I'm currently pursuing my IT degree part-time and
              fully-online at RMIT University to deepen my knowledge and
              hands-on experience in the field. In my free time, I love
              expanding my skill set by building personal projects and
              experimenting with different languages. I'm always up for a
              challenge and I'm excited to see what the future holds. I am a
              playful, curious and willing learner, who is always eager to
              explore new things and to take on new challenges.
